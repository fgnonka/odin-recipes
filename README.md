From the Odin Project Tutorial

Day 1 of DJolo journal(April,11, 2022):

This README will be a journal, which will document my programming progress as time goes.

I started learning programming after a conversation I had with my brother-in-law on March 18, 2022. He has been doing it for more than a decade
and he opened my eyes on the possibilities that programming could open in my life. He advised me to learn Python, which was the most popular programming language and one of the easiest to learn.
Since then, I have rushed on YouTube, and many online resources, and realized that there is a vast amount of information for anyone willing to learn about programming.
I have been using so far FreeCodeCamp.org, The Odin Project, Mimo App, Harvard CS50 courses and MIT Opencourseware. And just with these resources, there is so much I feel I need to learn.

I started with Python, and I have a fair grasp of the basics. I am able to build tiny projects, and I will keep uploading them as they become more personalized.
I also am learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, which I believe are easy to learn and will allow me to get an entry level position in the technology field.
From there, I would want to learn more about mobile applications.
